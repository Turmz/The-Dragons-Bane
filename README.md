# The Dragons Bane
A really basic text-based game, played on you commandprompt.

"As soon as you leave the gates of your city you are attacked by monsters. 
Your guards are frightened because they have never seen creatures like these so you pull out your sword and fight with them. 
They remind you of the monsters that were created by the late mad scientist Baldo that you defeated 10 years ago."
